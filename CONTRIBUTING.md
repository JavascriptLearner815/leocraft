# CONTRIBUTING
## Preamble
Whenever you contribute to this project, you agree to these guidelines and any other guidelines mentioned.

* <https://github.com/JavascriptLearner815/leocraft/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>
* <https://github.com/JavascriptLearner815/leocraft/blob/master/LICENSE>

All of the guidelines that have been imposed on the project are intended to foster an open and welcoming environment for everyone; everyone can freely use the software and 
the information inside the project. The intent is not to create strict rules for everyone to follow, it is to foster a civil environment.

Enjoy your rights to use and distribute the software freely!

## BEGIN
### Scope
Representation of the project includes:
* Using an offical project e-mail address
* Posting via an offical social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Any other works that include content that can reasonably be associated with the project
* Adding your own content to another copy of the project in another work
### Enforcement
Any type of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at summerdean66@gmail.com.

When reporting unacceptable behavior, try to add these details as it will help us investigate the problem faster:
* A link to the profile of the user you are trying to report
* Optionally, the date in which the user had done the unacceptable behavior
* Content explaining where the user had done the unacceptable behavior 
* Content explaining why you are reporting the user
* Optionally, information to help investigate the problem
* Optionally, additional information you want to add

Try to make the report organized and clean, but keep it precise. This will help keep the time needed to investigate the problem shorter, and make the work the maintainers 
do more efficient.
### Repercussions 
Despite all of this effort we have made to prevent unacceptable behavior, it does happen. Therefore, we have to make levels of repercussions early so less people
will act with unacceptable behavior, and so that the people that DO act with unacceptable behavior can find a resolution to the problem. 

Please note that these are just some of the basic things we will do to take action if something has gone wrong in the community. 

Repercussion levels
1. A public warning to the person, ideally in the place that they did the bad behavior in the first place, and a private message to the user if necessary
1. If the user still does not want to change their behavior, a 2nd public warning in even more detail, and a private message to the user if necessary
1. If the user will still not change their behavior, the content will be removed that was considered unacceptable behavior
1. The user will be blocked from the project
1. The user will be KICKED (banned for a few seconds) from the project
1. The user will be BANNED for 7 days from the project
1. The user will be BANNED for 15 days from the project
1. The user will be BANNED for 30 days from the project
1. The user will be BANNED for 2 months from the project
1. The user will be BANNED for 6 months from the project
1. The user will be BANNED for a year from the project
1. The user will be PERMANENTLY BANNED from the project

Mutes, kicks, and bans will NOT be taken lightly; they will only be done when it is clear that there will be no resolution to the problem.
Right now, we hope that we will NEVER have to permanently ban people from the project, but sometimes there are just people that we will have to permanently ban
from the project.
